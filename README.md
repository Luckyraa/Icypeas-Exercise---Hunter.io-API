# Review of my Exercise

Hello Icypeas Recruting Team,

Here is my job on the Hunter.io API Exercise ! I took about 4 hours to do it, I hope it will fit your expectations.

Just a little thing, it was specified to write a formula in this style "FindEmail(A2, B2, C2)", mine is exactly the same but with ";" instead of "," so I hope you will be able to test it correctly.

Here is the link to my Google Sheet : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kj9DDZROFOQxl3didI5kiw83JfGU-743MmENLNuFWSU/edit?usp=sharing
